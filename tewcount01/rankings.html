If you find signing workers too tedious and that you have too many stats to look at then look no further; This excel spreadsheet combines all attributes and determines each worker's overall rating. If you plan on using this then make sure you read all of the following to understand how to properly use it!

<p>
The TEWcount Rankings is a large excel file that lists workers and sorts them based on their 'TEWcount rating', which has been calculated by looking at various worker attributes. Each worker's ranking determines how useful they are to each type of promotion.
</p>

<p>
<i>Make sure that when you open it you enable macros if you want to be able to quickly sort the rankings.</i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Sheet descriptions</b>
</p>

<p>
Stats: This worksheet shows the value of each stat to each type of promotion, ranging from 1-10, 10 being the best. You can freely change the yellow cells here, if you wish.
</p>

<p>
Age: This worksheet shows the points given from different ages. The Peak Age is currently set to 35. For example, if you don't mind using older workers then you can change this to 40. The Multiplier determines how much points each age is worth. The higher you set it to the more points younger workers will get and the less points older workers will get.
</p>

<p>
Entry: This sheet is where you enter all of your workers. Enter numbers to represent the attributes, F being the lowest grade and equalling 0, A* being the highest and representing 10. For a quick list for reference scroll to the bottom of this page. For example, Tommy Cornell has a stiffness rating of C+, therefore 5 has been entered. For overness, the average U.S. overness has been used. By default, each worker's age is set to 35. Make sure you correct this when entering a worker.
</p>

<p>
Promotion Style sheets: All of the other sheets display each worker's worth to that type of promotion. If you want to sort a list to put the highest scoring worker at the top then make sure you have macros enabled and press 'Ctrl + s'. If you want to sort all of the promotion style sheets at once then instead use 'Ctrl + d'. Cell A1 contains the number that the total will be rounded by. The 'Rounded TOTAL' is there simply to provide a more simple number to refer to.
</p>

<p>
<u>Grade points</u>
<br />A* = 10
<br />A = 9
<br />B+ = 8
<br />B = 7
<br />B- = 6
<br />C+ = 5
<br />C = 4
<br />C- = 3
<br />D = 2
<br />E = 1
<br />F = 0
</p>

<p>
<b>Progress</b>
</p>

<p>
At the moment the entry sheet only has a few examples from the CornellVerse. We will be adding all CornellVerse U.S.-based workers over the coming days/weeks, to complete the sheet. You may wish to wait until then before you use this guide.
</p>

<p>
We will also be adding Worker Styles to the spreadheet. This will mean for example psychopaths get less points in pure promotions and entertainers fit better with sports entertainment.
</p>

<p>
If you feel the attribute points we have specified are inaccurate then you can freely modify them yourself by changing values in the 'Stats' sheet. We will also be perfecting this sheet as much as we can.
